## About Me
Hello, I’m a passionate and experienced Data enthusiast with expertise in Data Analytics, Data Visualization and Predictive Modeling. I empower businesses to drive growth by deriving actionable insights with data; optimizing performance to boost productivity.

With a strong foundation and proficiency in Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib), SQL, Power BI, and Excel,, I've tackled complex problems across several industries such developing a diabetes predictive system for healthcare, designing dynamic and interactive dashboards and reports for finance, a proven track record of delivering impactful data solutions across other sectors.

I’ve worked on several projects with esteemed organizations and companies to make business driven decisions.
Notably, I‘ve worked with The World Bank as a Data Analyst Facilitator in training, managing and instructing over 100 students at KEEK Computers (in collaboration with the Federal Ministry of Education) with a 95% success rate, and also at SkyHUB Nigeria, where I've developed analytical frameworks, curriculum, created interactive dashboards, and implemented predictive models that improved business efficiency by up to 30%.

My projects demonstrate my strong ability to apply data-driven insights to solve practical problems. I have designed and deployed professional-grade machine learning apps on streamlit and interactive dashboards on Power BI and have earned certifications in Machine Learning with Python (Anaconda) and Data Analytics (Microsoft, LinkedIn, BCG, and Quantium).

I'm eager to leverage my expertise and passion in technology and data science in general, driving innovation and growth through data-driven insights.
